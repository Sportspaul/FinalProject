<h2>The Problem</h2>
<div id="theProblem"><p>Sleep, alongside food and water are physiological needs, and biological 
requirements to function properly as a human. If these requirements are not sufficiently met, 
you can’t perform optimal in other aspects of life. Managing your everyday tasks can be challenging, 
sleep becomes underpriortized, and getting enough might be difficult. Have you ever fallen asleep in 
class, on the bus or in front of the tv while watching your favourite show? Maybe you needed a quick 
powernap to get your energy level back up but slept to long, or maybe you overslept and missed an 
important meeting. Regardless sleep is necessary, and you deserve to be able to control your day 
and have a good night sleep. We believe that a technological device can solve these problems and 
ultimately improve your health.

<!--Our Product-->
<div id="sleepOnMetro">

<div id="ourProduct"> 
<h2>Our product</h2>
<p> Our solution is SleepLezz, a wearable wristband. The idea is that the users should get better 
control over their sleeping habits. The wristband wakes you up by vibrating, and if the user is not 
responding to the vibrations SleepLezz will give the user an electric shock. For some people the 
fear of the shock is enough to stay awake, but for others the adrenaline produced after a 
shock will provide them with the boost they need. The shock is not designed to hurt you, 
but it must be strong enough to wake you. The purpose is to make you aware of your actions, 
and program your brain to stay awake through negative conditioning. Our product will use the 
same principles to keep you from falling asleep in class, on the bus or in front of the tv while 
watching your favourite show. SleepLezz uses heart rate data to get detailed info from your sleep. 
While an accelerometer measures how much you move during the night. 
Bluetooth connects the app and the device. The device has a chargeable battery with battery 
life up to 5 days with normal use. The SleepLezz wristband is compatible with an app. By 
using the companion app, you will be able to control when you want to sleep and when not to. 
<br><br>
Our vision is to wake you up feeling rested and awake. Give you full control over your 
sleeping pattern. Go to bed feeling tired and wake up fully rested ready for a new 
beautiful day.

<!--Powernap Buddy-->
<div id="powernapBuddy">
<div class="appText">
<h3>Powernap Buddy</h3>
<p>A powernap has proven benefits like improved cognitive skills, 
memory, creativity and it gives you a great energy boost, 
but only if you do it the right way. Power napping can be hard, 
if you fall into deep sleep you will most likely wake up feeling 
groggier than before. This function will help you wake up feeling 
more energized. Sleeping for too long will also have a negative 
effect on your ability to fall asleep at night. 
Therefore the application. will only allow you to set a timer
for a maximum of 20 minutes. SleepLezz will 
also make sure you get the most out of your powernap by starting 
your timer the exact moment you fall asleep.</p>

<!--Theories-->
<div id="link4"></div> 
<div id="theories">
<h3>Theories</h3>
<p>The functionality of SleepLezz is inspired by the American psychologist 
B. F. Skinner’s theory on negative reinforcement. Negative Punishment 
after a specific behaviour will train your brain to not repeat it. 
Negative punishment is most effective when it immediately follows a 
response and it’s applied consistently. Sleeplezz causes a negative 
punishment, in the form of an electric shock after an unwanted behaviour, 
that is falling asleep. By design our products punishment is both consistent and occurs 
immediately after unwanted behaviour.<br><br>
Our product is also inspired by the American psychologist Abramham Maslow’s theories of 
human motivation and development. Maslow describes a pyramid of needs, that is important for 
every human. The hierarchy is divided into 5 stages, and the bottom stages must be fulfilled 
before moving on to the next. The last stages consist of self-actualization and esteem. 
On the bottom of the pyramid are the physiological need. Among food, water and shelter we find sleep. </p>
