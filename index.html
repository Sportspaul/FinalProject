        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <div id="theProblem"><p>Sleep, alongside food and water are physiological needs, 
            and biological requirements to function properly as a human. If these requirements 
            are not sufficiently met, you can’t perform optimal in other aspects of life. 
            Managing your everyday tasks can be challenging, therefore getting enough sleep 
            could be difficult. Have you ever fallen asleep in class, on the bus or in front of 
            the tv while watching your favourite show? Maybe you needed a quick powernap to get 
            your energy level back up but slept to long, or maybe you overslept and missed an 
            important meeting. Regardless sleeping is necessary, and you deserve to be able to 
            control your day and have a good night sleep. We believe that a technological 
            device can solve these problems and ultimately improve your health.

                <h2>Our product</h2>
                    <p> Our solution is SleepLezz, a wearable wristband. 
                        The idea is that the users should get better control over their 
                        sleeping habits. The wristband wakes you up by vibrating, and if 
                        the user is not responding to the vibrations SleepLezz will give the
                         user an electric shock. For some people the fear of the shock is enough 
                         to stay awake, but for others the adrenaline produced after a shock will 
                         provide them with the boost they need. The shock is not designed to hurt 
                         you, but it must be strong enough to wake you. The purpose is to make you 
                         aware of your actions, and program your brain to stay awake through negative 
                         conditioning. SleepLezz uses heart rate data to get detailed 
                         info from your sleep. While an accelerometer measures how much you move during the night. 
                         Bluetooth connect the app and the device. The device has a 
                         Chargeable battery with battery life up to 5 days with normal use. 
                         The SleepLezz wristband is compadeble with an app. By using the companion app, you will be able to control when 
                         you want to sleep and when not to.
                        <br><br>
                        Our vision is to wake you up feeling rested and awake. 
                        Get full control over your sleeping patterns. 
                        No more falling asleep in class, on the bus or in front of the tv 
                        watching your favourite show. Go to bed feeling tired and wake up fully 
                        rested ready for a new beautiful day.

                                    <p>A powernap has proven benefits like improved cognitive skills,

                                <h2>Theories</h2>
                                <p>The functionality of SleepLezz is inspired by the American psychologist 
                                    B. F. Skinner’s theory on negative reinforcement. Negative Punishment 
                                    after a specific behaviour will train your brain to not repeat it. 
                                    Negative punishment has most effective when it immediately follows a 
                                    response and it’s applied consistently. Sleeplezz causes a negative 
                                    punishment, in the form of an electric shock after an unwanted behaviour, 
                                    that is falling asleep. Our products punishment is both consistent and 
                                    immediately after the behaviour.<br><br>
