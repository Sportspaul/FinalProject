        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <div id="theProblem"><p>Sleep and rest are fundamental for every human being. 
            But it`s not always easy to have full control over when to go to sleep and when not to. 
            Maybe you slept to long and struggle to fall asleep at the end of the day. 
            Maybe you needed a quick powernap to get your energy level back up but slept to long.

                <h2>Our product</h2>
                    <p>Our solution is SleepLezz, a wearable wristband and smartwatch. 
                        The idea is that the user should get more control over his/hers sleeping patterns. 
                        By using the companion app, you will be able to control when you want to sleep and when 
                        you want to wake up. The wristband wakes you up by vibrating, then if the user is not 
                        responding to the vibrations, SleepLezz will give the user an electric shock. 
                        For some people the fear of the shock is enough to stay awake, but for others 
                        the adrenaline produced after a shock is the boost they need stay awake. 
                        Our vision is to wake you up feeling rested and awake. Get full control over your 
                        sleeping patterns. No more falling asleep in class, on the bus or in front of the 
                        tv watching your favorite show. Go to bed feeling tired and wake up fully rested 
                        ready for a new beautiful day.  
                        <br><br> The shock is not designed to hurt you, but it has to be strong enough to wake you. 
                        The purpose is to make you aware of your actions, 
                        and program your brain to stay awake through negative conditioning. 
                        SleepLezz uses heart rate data to get detailed info from your sleep. 
                        While an accelerometer measures how much you move during the night. 
                        Bluetooth connect the app and the device. The device has a Chargeable battery with battery 
                        life up to 5 days with normal use.

                        <div id="application"><p>
                            <p>With the wearable there is a companion app. The app features include: 
                            alarm, sleepstats and Powernap buddy. The alarm feature lets you set a time to 
                            wake up, but your wearable device uses your sleep data to wake up at an appropriate 
                            time according your sleep cycle. (In order to avoid grogginess.)</p>

                                <h2>Theories</h2>
                                <p>The functionality of SleepLezz is inspired by the American psychologist 
                                    B. F. Skinner’s theory on negative reinforcement. Negative Punishment 
                                    after a specific behaviour will train your brain to not repeat it. 
                                    Negative punishment has most effective when it immediately follows a 
                                    response and it’s applied consistently. Sleeplezz causes a negative 
                                    punishment, in the form of an electric shock after an unwanted behaviour, 
                                    that is falling asleep. Our products punishment is both consistent and 
                                    immediately after the behaviour. </p>
